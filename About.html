        <h1 style="color:aliceblue">1. Story</h1>
        <p style="color:aliceblue; font-size:20px">Deadly Shivers was made by YngDev. He wanted to test all the skills he learned in the past 2 years and create the best game he's ever made. Using <a href="https://www.construct.net/en" style="color:red">Contruct 3</a> he worked for the project for almost 8 months. With the help of his friends he started beta-testing the project finally, on 16th March 2024, he released the final game on <a href="https://itch.io/" style="color:red">itch.io</a></p>
        <h1 style="color:aliceblue">2. Gameplay</h1>
        <p style="color:aliceblue; font-size:20px">Deadly Shivers is a survival-horror game. You are locked in a maze with a terrifying creature called <a href="https://nextbot.fandom.com/wiki/Pinhead" style="color:red">Pinhead</a>, a monster famous for being a nextbot in many games. All you have to do is escaping from it. And remember, he will always find you. It's recommended to use headphones for a better experience, since you need audio to hear the monster coming. But don't worry, if you don't have any audio output, you can always use the "ghost radar", and will let you know if there are any monsters nearby. If it detects somthing, RUN!</p>
